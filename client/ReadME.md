## About this project

Anime figures are a very expensive hobby. Depending on the type of figure someone is looking for it can range up to $100s of dollars and more depending on the character someone is looking for. Looking around online there are multiple websites that cater to the trading of anime figures, but I thought the UI could be a little bit better, so this is a portfolio project I decided to create and I hope to expand it and make it an actual working site. 

A user would be able to set up a little profile showing up what figures they are looking for and what figures they have up for trade, sort of like an etsy shop of sorts.
